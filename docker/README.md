# Nginx proxy for ArchivesSpace

The Nginx proxy provides a single access point for routing to the
ArchivesSpace server applications. It can run in two modes:

- `single`
  - public and staff interfaces are available via the same hostname
- `multi`
  - public and staff interfaces are available via separate hostnames

## Test

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up
UPSTREAM_HOST=app docker compose up
```

## Publish

```bash
./build_and_push.sh
```

To also push to ECR install the [ecr credentials helper](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-ecr-credential-helper?tab=readme-ov-file#installing).

Then set these envvars:

```
export AWS_PROFILE=archivesspace # set the profile name
export ASPACE_PROXY_ECR_IMG=513816696638.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/archivesspace:proxy # set img
./build_and_push.sh
```
